# Pack Generator
Pack generator is a simple script for creating blank Resource/Behavior packs.

The imagined use case is quickly and easily having the ability to summon an entity into a world. This is useful just to make sure "everything is working" before you begin importing models.

## Features:
 - Randomizes UUIDs, so each pack is unique
 - Includes a "box" and a "dummy" entity, which provide clean examples of renderable and invisible entities.
 - Include base structure for most commonly used features.

## How to run:
This script uses python 3.x.

Run: `python create.py` from the parent folder (pack_generator).

You can drag the blank_RP and blank_BP from the `out` folder directly into your world.

## Downloadable pack:

You can also download the `blank_pack.zip` if you just need instant access to an example pack. Please note that the UUIDs are NOT randomized in this pack, and this pack shoulden't be used for actual projects.
